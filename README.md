# Hey, I'm Marwan 👋

I’m a second-year **Intelligent Systems Engineering** student who likes to grab an idea, then force it to work with wires, code, and way too many serial prints.

Right now I’m obsessed with the space where **embedded systems**, **robotics**, and **AI** overlap.

---

## 🔧 What I build with

* **Hardware / Embedded:** Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, sensors, motors, 7-segment displays, random modules I probably shouldn’t have bought but did anyway
* **Languages:** C/C++ and Python
* **Comfort zone:** breadboards, jumper wires, jumping between “why is this not working” and “ohhh, that’s actually cool”

I like projects that start as *“can I even make this work?”* and end as *“okay, it works, now let me document it so future me (and others) don’t suffer.”*

---

## 🤖 What I’m into

* **Hardware–software integration** – taking microcontrollers, sensors, and code then turning them into actual working devices
* **Embedded systems & robotics** – sensor fusion, simple robots, low-cost builds
* **AI basics** – small experiments tying models to hardware (nothing fancy… yet)

I mainly work on **Linux**, where I code, test, and debug most of my embedded, robotics, and AI projects.

## 🔭 Projects

* [**8-bit-digital-logic-calculator**](https://github.com/marwan-alfarra/8-bit-digital-logic-calculator)
  8-bit calculator built in the **Digital** logic simulator with three implementations (gates, decoders, multiplexers), plus reusable subcircuits for adders, multipliers, DDA, and seven-segment drivers.

I’m slowly moving more of my **desk experiments** (Arduino/ESP32/Python) into public repos, so this list will eventually grow with robots, tools, and whatever else I break and fix along the way.

## 🌱 What I’m learning right now

* Writing a cleaner, more **serious C/C++** for embedded and robotics
* Stronger **Python** for tools, testing, and small data/AI experiments
* **ROS 2** and better ways to structure robots that aren’t just `while(true)` + `delay`
* How to document projects so other people can actually clone, build, and use them

---

## 🤝 Community & collaboration

I don’t like learning alone.
I’m active in **IEEE**, hackathons, and student communities, and I really believe that **community learning** is the fastest path to real innovation — when people share skills, help each other debug, and build things that actually matter.

If you’re into hardware, Python, or plugging AI into embedded systems, I’m always down to:

* brainstorm project ideas
* help with simple circuits / code
* build something messy and iterate on it
